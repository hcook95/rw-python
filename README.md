# DEPRICATED!!!
For the last while, the RapidWright team has made RapidWright installable in python3 with a simple `pip install rapidwright` (see [](https://www.rapidwright.io/docs/Install_RapidWright_as_a_Python_PIP_Package.html) for more details). This means this repository is no longer a convenient way to install RapidWright in Python. However, I am leaving it up for posterity's sake, and in case the examples are helpful for anyone.

# ~~RapidWright Python~~
~~This repository provides a simple way to get started using RapidWright via Python3.~~

~~RapidWright is written in Java, and as such is normally used in Java environments.~~
~~However, setting up the RapidWright environment in Java can be cumbersome.~~
~~Additionally many people (especially those first getting started with RapidWright) prefer Python to java, thus the makers of RapidWright have come out with a way to use the RapidWright API in a Python3 environment using JPype1.~~
~~The JPype1 Python library exposes Java APIs to Python as if they were native.~~

~~This repository packages the setup instructions found [here](https://www.rapidwright.io/docs/Install_RapidWright_as_a_Python_PIP_Package.html) into a setup.sh script for convenience.~~
~~In addition, this repository contains a few tutorials written in Python3 to help new users get started.~~

## Getting Started

Before getting started with this repository, it is highly recommended to familiarize yourself with the [RapidWright Documentation](https://www.rapidwright.io/docs/), particularly the introduction through the "Implementation Basics" section.

To setup the RapidWright Python environment, run `make` in the top directory.
This will download, install, and setup everything needed for the RapidWright environment.
After the environment has been setup, one can enter the associated Python environment by running `source activate` and leave the environment by running `deactivate`.

As the [RapidWright for Python Instructions](https://www.rapidwright.io/docs/Install_RapidWright_as_a_Python_PIP_Package.html) state, you can run rapidwright.py in interactive mode by running `python -i rapidwright.py`.
This allows you to explore the various APIs. In addition, running this script in interactive mode will allow you to use tab-complete on the RapidWright Java Classes.

for example, after instantiating a AWS_F1 device with `device = Device.getDevice(Device.AWS_F1)`, one can tab complete `device.` to get the following:
```
>>> device.
device.AWS_F1                         device.getClass(                      device.getSLRByConfigOrderIndex(
device.DEVICE_FILE_VERSION            device.getClockRegion(                device.getSLRs(
device.FRAMEWORK_NAME                 device.getClockRegionFromTile(        device.getSeries(
device.FRAMEWORK_NAME_AND_VERSION     device.getClockRegions(               device.getSite(
device.KCU105                         device.getColumns(                    device.getSiteFromPackagePin(
device.PYNQ_Z1                        device.getDevice(                     device.getSitePin(
device.QUIET_MESSAGE                  device.getDeviceName(                 device.getSiteTypeCount(
device.RAPIDWRIGHT_MINOR_VERSION      device.getDeviceVersion(              device.getTile(
device.RAPIDWRIGHT_QUARTER_VERSION    device.getFamilyType(                 device.getTileTypeCount(
device.RAPIDWRIGHT_VERSION            device.getMasterSLR(                  device.getTiles(
device.RAPIDWRIGHT_YEAR_VERSION       device.getName(                       device.getWire(
device.RW_QUIET_MESSAGE               device.getNode(                       device.hashCode(
device.a(                             device.getNumOfClockRegionRows(       device.notify(
device.equals(                        device.getNumOfClockRegionsColumns(   device.notifyAll(
device.getActivePackage(              device.getNumOfSLRs(                  device.quietReflectiveAccessWarning(
device.getAllCompatibleSites(         device.getPIP(                        device.releaseDeviceReferences(
device.getAllSitesOfType(             device.getPackage(                    device.setActivePackage(
device.getAllTiles(                   device.getPackages(                   device.toString(
device.getArchitecture(               device.getRows(                       device.wait(
device.getAvailableDevices(           device.getSLR(
>>> device.
```
It can also be helpful when using RapidWright to refer to the [RapidWright JavaDocs](https://www.rapidwright.io/javadoc/).

## Tutorials
There are four tutorials found in the tutorials directory. 
These tutorials focus on four potential use cases of RapidWright. 
These use cases are: 
- Using RapidWright to extract information of a device.
- Using RapidWright to extract information of a design.
- Using RapidWright to create a design from scratch.
- Using RapidWright to route a design.

These tutorials are meant to be simple and straight forward. 
They do not represent everything that RapidWright can be used for.
Additional, more advanced tutorials can be found [here](https://www.rapidwright.io/docs/Tutorials.html). These additional tutorials are mostly written for the java version of RapidWright, and so additional work may be required to do them in Python.

### numOfMemLUTs (Device Info)
This tutorial shows how to use RapidWright to extract some basic
information of a device. While this example can be easily replicated
in Vivado using a couple tcl commands, it is often desirable to use 
RapidWright to get device information for the performance advantage
and ease of post processing in languages such as Java or Python.

### netSizes (Design Info)
This tutorial shows how to use RapidWright to extract some basic
information of a design. It also does some post-processing (plotting
the info in matplotlib) to show some of the advantages of using
RapidWright with Python.

###  basicCircuit (Design Creation)
This tutorial shows how to make a simple design in RapidWright. Note
that this tutorial outputs a .dcp file. To get a bitstream one must
open the resulting .dcp file in Vivado and use the 'write_bitstream'
command.

This tutorial is based on Lesson1 of the RapidWright tutorial found
here: https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright/blob/master/src/com/xilinx/rapidwright/examples/Lesson1.java

### rwroute (Design Router)
RWRoute is a new open-source, timing-based router written in RapidWright.
It provides a substantial speedup to routing when
compared to Vivado's router, with a sacrifice in the critical path delay.
This may be useful for applications such as quick design iterations.

This program not as much of a tutorial as much as it 
is a simple wrapper over the RWRouter main function. To use
simply run 'python rwroute <input.dcp> <output.dcp>'.
Note that RWRoute currently only works with UltraScale+
devices.

This file also contains the code of RWRoute.main() converted from Java into Python.
This code is commented out, and can be used to understand and manipulate the main
function of RWRoute.
